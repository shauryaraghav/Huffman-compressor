# Huffman-compressor
My first project on github where i compress files taken form user using huffman coding

HuffmanFlow is a client-side web application that demonstrates the power of the Huffman Coding algorithm. It allows users to upload text files, visualize the resulting binary tree, and download a compressed version of their data.

Key Features

Real-Time File Processing: Uses the JavaScript FileReader API to analyze .txt files locally in the browser.

Dynamic Tree Visualization: Leverages D3.js to generate a scalable vector graphic (SVG) of the Huffman Tree, making the "greedy" merging process transparent.

Compression Verification: Provides a side-by-side comparison of Standard ASCII (8-bit) vs. Huffman Encoding to show space-saving percentages.

Custom File Archiving: Generates a downloadable compressed file containing a metadata header (for the dictionary) and the encoded binary payload.
